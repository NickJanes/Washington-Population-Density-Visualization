# [Washington Population Density](https://nickjanes.github.io/Washington-Population-Density-Visualization/)
## Description
A visualization of Washington State's county populations displayed by a heat map built using d3.js.

## Why
To give viewers a better understanding of the population distributions within the state of Washington.

## Quick Start
This visualization can be viewed live here: [LINK](https://nickjanes.github.io/Washington-Population-Density-Visualization/)

## Usage
There are two buttons that can be toggled for a better viewing experience.
- "Toggle County Boundary" - removes the boundaries between counties for a more contiguous viewing.
- "Change Color Scheme" - changes to a darker color palette to make the most populous counties more obvious.

Additionally, users can hover the counties to see additional data per county such as the county name or population per square mile.
